# Munich-Ventilator-Build-Group
What do we need to learn, to source, in order to build many reliable, safe and cost effectice Open Source Ventilators as possible. 

Some questions to consider:
What available designs best suit functional and operator needs?
Which parts of the available designs suit the current supply chain situation 
  What parts can be swapped with alternative materials or parts? 
  What is non-negotiable and ?
What from the Firmware side do we need to develop ourselves that isn't available in current solutions?
